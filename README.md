## Smart Contracts

This is a set of [Smart Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) on Ethereum.
Reason to use is the ability to programatically (mathematically) ensure the outcomes of important interaction, such as:

- grant a token which will expire automatically
- list paymements
- list token usage

## Use Cases
1. User aquires N amount of tokens
2. Each token represents a timespan, token holder address, how it could be used, and if it was used or not

## Security
Smart contracts are heavily influenced by [OpenZeppelin work](https://openzeppelin.org/api/docs/open-zeppelin.html) which focuses on community standards driven source code in Solidity. 
In addition, transparency of Ethereum Blockchain is adding audiatibility of all the steps.
